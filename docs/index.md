# Social Lense Online DATATHON and HACKATHON

Want to learn about online hate speech like antisemitism and how to combat it using Artificial Intelligence?

Join a team or compose your own to participate in 

- a DATATHON where students learn how to create and analyze corpora and big data and
- a HACKATHON where students learn how to create and use AI algorithms

in a series of competitive team-based workshops coached by IU professors.

All high school students are invited to apply!

No prior knowledge is required but some experience with programming may be useful. 

Read the competition guidelines, and complete a team or individual application.

Cash prizes: $200 - $500


Online hate speech, including anti-Semitism, is a growing problem for communication on social media, such as Twitter. It has a global, regional, and local impact. Online and offline anti-Semitic incidents have increased in recent years and have had an impact even in some high schools across the country. 
We will train a group of high-school students and University undergraduates in 4 competitive workshops to recognize antisemitic messages on social media and to develop tools how to track them by using AI.
What are prominent forms of antisemtism online?  Who are frequent disseminators and how are they linked internationally?  How does hate speech travel across the globe and what can be done about it?

IU Professors [Damir Cavar](http://damir.cavar.me/) and Gunther Jikeli will lead 4 workshops where they coach competitive teams of students to recognize, monitor, and track antisemitic messages on social media (focusing on Twitter). This includes information on current forms of antisemitism and their history, a datathon where students learn how to deal with big data, and a hackathon, where students learn to make use of AI.

A prize will be given to the best three teams (worth $ 500, $ 300, and $ 200) 

The winners will be honored in a public event that includes presentation of the first results and a public debate on strengths, limitations, and moral implications of observing and combating antisemitism with AI. 

No prior knowledge is required but some experience with programming will help. However, teams of 3-5 students will be formed that include students who focus on content, students who focus on data analysis, and students who focus on programming.

You can apply as a team (e.g. from one school) or as an individual student and we will team you up.


A select group of IU professors representing Computational Linguistics and the Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism are excited to share with you the details of a brand new team-based computing competition and datathon for high schoolers and college undergraduates which will take place during the Fall 2019 semester on the beautiful Indiana University Bloomington campus. 

# Contest Design -

By participating, your students will learn how to recognize messages of hate against Jews on social media, learn about its historical background, engage in critical thinking and creative problem-solving, flex and develop their intellectual and computing muscles, cooperate with others to create a useful product, and gain valuable experience with sophisticated Artificial Intelligence algorithms, knowledge of which can later help them build prestigious and lucrative careers in several related fields. 

Just as importantly, your students will also contribute to the scientific study and analysis of online hate speech, making them junior partners in the JEDI (Just Environments Data Initiative) mission to combat the dissemination of hate speech in online environments like Facebook and Twitter. For the current competition, teams will employ AI algorithms to collect and analyze anti-Semitic messages, which among other forms of online hate speech are a growing problem for communication on social media.

Having reviewed this general competition description and contest timeline, please share the attached competition flyer widely with teachers and students across high schools in your district. Our flyer contains a link to the official Datathon website (insert URL here as well), where all school personnel as well as aspiring student contenders can learn more about the contest design as well as about the process of team formation, read the entry and participation guidelines, complete and submit a secure application form (application and contest entry are both FREE), “meet” the contest judges, view our sponsor list, and take a look at the impressive cash prizes to be claimed by our three top-scoring teams!

All high school students are invited to apply (we welcome applications anytime from now through August 31). We want to enlist your help as educators in attracting some of your best and brightest students to participate in this enriching computer deep learning and data-processing challenge.       

Note: Students may apply as a team of 3-5 students (see website for guidelines) or individually to be matched by us with a team. No prior knowledge is required though some programming experience may be useful.
